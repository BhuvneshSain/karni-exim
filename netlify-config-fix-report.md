# Netlify Configuration Fix Report

## 🐛 Issue Identified
Netlify build was failing with the error:
```
Could not parse configuration file
Can't redefine existing key at row 32, col 29
X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
```

## ✅ Root Cause
The `netlify.toml` file had duplicate header entries:
- `X-Frame-Options` was defined twice
- `X-XSS-Protection` was defined twice

## 🔧 Fix Applied
Removed the duplicate headers from the `[[headers]]` section in `netlify.toml`.

### Before (Broken):
```toml
[headers.values]
Cache-Control = "public, max-age=3600"
X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
X-Frame-Options = "DENY"          # ❌ Duplicate
X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block" # ❌ Duplicate
```

### After (Fixed):
```toml
[headers.values]
Cache-Control = "public, max-age=3600"
X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

## ✅ Verification
- ✅ Build test passed: `npm run build:netlify`
- ✅ No configuration syntax errors
- ✅ All security headers properly configured
- ✅ Domain redirects configured correctly

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Push this fix to your repository
2. Netlify will automatically redeploy
3. Your site should build successfully
4. Continue with domain setup for karniexim.com

## 📋 Current Configuration Features
- ✅ SPA routing handled
- ✅ Security headers configured
