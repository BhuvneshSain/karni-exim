# Karni Exim Project - Bug Fix Report

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Contact Page Map Error (`net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`)
- **Problem:** Google Maps iframe was being blocked by privacy extensions/settings
- **Solution:** Replaced Google Maps with OpenStreetMap which is less likely to be blocked
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/pages/Contact.jsx`

### 2. Missing Admin Directory
- **Problem:** Scripts in package.json referenced files in a non-existent admin directory
- **Solution:** Created the admin directory with the necessary utility scripts
- **Files Created:**
  - `admin/update-reviews-flags.mjs`
  - `admin/fix-review-timestamps.mjs`
  - `admin/verify-reviews.js`
  - `cleanup.js`

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Confirmed that `.env` file exists for Firebase configuration

## Remaining Issues and Recommendations

### 1. Firebase Authentication
- Ensure Firebase credentials in `.env` are valid
- If users are experiencing `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` with Firestore, consider implementing offline fallbacks or a server-side API

### 2. Environment-Specific Checks
- Added robust error handling in admin scripts for Firebase configuration
- Fixed path references in package.json scripts

### 3. Project Structure
- Created missing folders referenced in documentation:
  - `admin/` folder for maintenance scripts
- Fixed file paths in imports and scripts

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly, particularly:
   - Review management and display
   - Contact page map display
   - Product loading from Firestore

2. Consider implementing fallbacks for components that rely on external services:
   - Static images for maps
   - Cached data for product information

3. Run the provided admin scripts to ensure review data is properly structured:
   ```
   npm run fix-reviews
   npm run diagnose-reviews
   npm run verify-reviews
   ```

4. Check browser console for any remaining errors, particularly related to blocked resources
