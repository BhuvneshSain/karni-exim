# Remove "Keep Only Latest" Feature - Review Management

## 🗑️ Changes Made

Successfully removed the "Keep Only Latest" option from the Review Management component as requested.

### ✅ Removed Components:

1. **Function Removal**:
   - Removed `deleteAllButMostRecent()` function (52 lines of code)
   - This function allowed deleting all reviews except the most recent one

2. **UI Button Removal**:
   - Removed "Keep Only Latest" button from the admin interface
   - Button was located in the top-right section of Review Management

3. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Removed unused imports:
     - `query`, `orderBy`, `limit` from Firebase Firestore
     - `FaTrashAlt` icon from react-icons
   - Cleaner, more maintainable code

### 📋 What Was Removed:

#### Deleted Function:
```javascript
const deleteAllButMostRecent = async () => {
  // Function that kept only the most recent review
  // and deleted all older reviews with confirmation
}
```

#### Deleted UI Element:
```jsx
<button
  onClick={deleteAllButMostRecent}
  className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded..."
  disabled={loading}
  title="Keep only the most recent review"
>
  <FaTrashAlt /> Keep Only Latest
</button>
```
